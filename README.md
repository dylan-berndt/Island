# Water Demo

This is a water rendering project I have been working on to learn OpenGL and create a framework I can use for other graphics programming projects.

## Current Progress

Framebuffers implemented, Vertex Array Objects made more flexible, some adjustments to the effects. 
Textures also implemented but not heavily utilized yet. Indexed Arrays will need similar flexibility upgrades.

## 12/28/23

So far, I have implemented Vertex Array Objects, Shaders, and basic lighting.
I'm currently working on Textures, Framebuffers, and reflections in hopes of creating a skybox and a better simulation.
