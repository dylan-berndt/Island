# Water Demo

This is a water rendering project I have been working on to learn OpenGL and create a framework I can use for other graphics programming projects.

So far, I have implemented Vertex Array Objects, Shaders, and basic lighting.
I'm currently working on Textures, Framebuffers, and reflections in hopes of creating a skybox and a better simulation.

##Current Progress:
